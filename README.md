# üß¢ The Logo Tax Behind University Bookstore Luxury

**Live project:** [The-Logo-Tax-Behind-University-Bookstore-Luxury](https://gracejiang0612.github.io/The-Logo-Tax-Behind-University-Bookstore-Luxury/)

## üìù Project Description

This data-driven story explores the hidden markup behind university-branded merchandise. The investigation was sparked by a personal experience: when a friend visited Columbia University, we toured the bookstore and were shocked by the steep prices of basic school gear. After speaking with classmates, I discovered that many students avoid the official Columbia Bookstore and instead shop at local retailers offering the same products at lower prices.

This moment led to a broader question: _Are students across the country paying a premium simply for a logo?_

## üîç What I Found

Through interviews, pricing comparisons, and independent data collection, the story uncovers:

- **Significant markups** on branded items sold at Columbia University Bookstore, especially in the recent Lululemon collaboration.  
  - Example: The *Everywhere Backpack* sells for **67% more** than at standard Lululemon stores.
- **Identical gear, different logos**: Many top U.S. universities, especially those using Barnes & Noble College, sell the same brand-name items with only the logo changed‚Äîbut with consistent price hikes.
- **Alternative options exist**: Independent stores like Ivy League Stationers offer the same items‚Äîoften from the same suppliers‚Äîat **30% or more below bookstore prices**.
- **This is a national trend**: Among the top 50 U.S. universities, average prices for branded merchandise are notably high, especially in Ivy League institutions.

## üßÆ Data Collection

- I **manually scraped** product listings from 50 top university bookstores' websites, recording prices for basic apparel combinations (hat, top, bottoms), accessories, and collaboration items (e.g., Lululemon).
- Collected data was cleaned and processed using **Python and pandas**.
- Visualizations were created in **Adobe Illustrator** to clearly communicate price disparities across schools.

## üìä Data Analysis

- Identified patterns in pricing by affiliation (Barnes & Noble vs. independent bookstores).
- Compared identical SKUs across university stores.
- Calculated average markups between branded and non-branded items.
- Benchmarked Ivy League pricing against public universities like the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## üß† Skills & Growth

- This was my first project using **Adobe Illustrator** to design polished static data visualizations.
- I learned to build my own **price comparison database** from scratch, simulating the rigor of consumer investigative journalism.
- I honed my **interview skills**, speaking with students, visitors, and local retailers to complement data findings with real voices.

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

If time and resources allowed, I would like to:

- Investigate the **licensing agreements** between universities and brands like Barnes & Noble College and Lululemon.
- Explore **trademark and pricing structures** that enable or enforce logo-based markups.
- Include **interactive visualizations** or **receipts/data uploads from students** for user-contributed price verification.
