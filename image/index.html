            <p>Columbia University's latest bookstore collaboration with Lululemon has drawn student interest -- and sticker shock. Students eagerly pulled Columbia-branded leggings and hoodies from gleaming racks. But the initial excitement died at the price tags -- many walking away after a single glance at the cost.</p>

            <figure>

            </figure>

            <p>"The price is unreasonable," said Kiko Zhong, a first-year graduate student at Columbia's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a self-proclaimed Lululemon enthusiast. "The jacket is identical to Lululemon's Define jacket -- the only difference is the logo."</p>

            </figure>

            <p>The data shows why students like Zhong are hesitating: identical Lululemon items cost on average 36% more at the Columbia Bookstore than at regular Lululemon stores. The markup reaches extreme levels on certain items -- the Everywhere Backpack, priced at $129.98, carries a striking 67% premium over Lululemon's standard $78 price tag. Even a basic Cates Tee jumps from $48 to $74.98, a 56% increase.</p>

            <p>For many, a university bookstore represents more than just a retail space. It's where dreams materialize into tangible symbols -- whether for hopeful high school students, proud parents or current students seeking to represent their school.</p>

            <p>Columbia is seen as a dream school by Grace Hyde, a high school student from Italy who was visiting New York City. Despite campus access being limited, a purchase from the bookstore was still desired. "I probably want to buy a sweatshirt, because I really like the prints, and I just want to have a memory that I will be using hopefully in the next years," Hyde said.</p>

            <p>Maya Paul is a first-year student at medical school at Columbia. She comes to bookstore to get a sweater as a birthday gift for herself. This is her first time visiting Columbia Bookstore. "I wish it (the price) was lower," Paul said. She seldom goes to bookstore. "I usually, if I'm here, I know it's gonna hit my wallet," Paul said. She also mentions the bookstore price in her undergraduate at University of Pennsylvania is also very high.</p>

            <p>However, the price of bookstores in many schools is too high, making the doorframe of their dream school out of reach for many students.</p>

            <p>Kiana Mehanian, a senior at Columbia College, regularly shops at her university's bookstore for folders and notebooks adorned with the Columbia emblem. Like many students, she's observed the premium pricing at college bookstores, but having lived in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York - America's most expensive cities - the prices don't shock her anymore.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>A comparison of New York City's university bookstores reveals significant price variations: Columbia University tops the chart with a basic outfit (including a hat, top, and bottoms) costing $80.96, while New York University's comparable outfit runs around $55.</p>

            <p>"It's a little higher than I think it should be, but I honestly haven't seen a university where that's not the case," Mehanian said, acknowledging a universal truth about collegiate merchandise. "Things wouldn't cost as much if they didn't have Columbia on it, but it's pretty much every school I see."</p>

            </figure>

            <p>A nationwide pennant prices across America's top 50 universities reveals an even more striking disparity. Columbia's pennants sell for $26.99, while the University of Wisconsin-Madison offers theirs at just $6.99 - a $20 difference for essentially the same decorative item with different institutional branding.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>The price of these basic hats across top 50 U.S. universities shows a pattern: 19 universities partnered with Barnes & Noble College, a company that operates college bookstores and offers academic services, all sell identical hats with different logos at exactly $29.98. This standardized pricing shows the company's uniform pricing strategy across its partner institutions.</p>

            <p>The price of college pride comes with a significant markup at university bookstores, with Ivy League institutions averaging $75.38 for their most basic fan outfit combination. This pricing trend shows a broader pattern in collegiate merchandise, where brand prestige directly influences cost.</p>

            <p>In response to these high bookstore prices, alternative retailers have emerged near campus locations. A prime example is Ivy League Stationers located across from Columbia University's main gate on 116th Street and Broadway. The store started at 1999, and in recent years began selling school gear at prices at least 30 percent lower than the bookstore.</p>

            <p>The store maintains product authenticity while intentionally keeping prices lower than their competition. "We listen to customers. If they complain that the prices are high at the bookstore, we got to listen that they price sensitive," said Justin Faye, the manager of the store.</p>

            <p>Faye explains that university bookstores often have higher prices due to trademark licensing. As he said, "whenever Columbia puts their trademark logo on an item, it goes up because from the source, from the supplier, the price is bumped up."</p>

            <p>He acknowledges that Columbia's positioning in the market affects pricing, though he emphasizes that not all Columbia students are wealthy. "Everybody at Columbia is not rich, I promise you. I know people come here and express that all the time," Faye said.</p>
